# Phase 0 run

Date: 2026-10-08 (JST). Result: pass.

This machine has no `D:` drive. The isolated checkout is `$HOME/projects/polymarket-pod` (`/root/projects/polymarket-pod`). Python 3.10 venv, `pip install -r requirements.txt` (standard library only; no order SDK). No `.env` was created or read. No order, auth, or withdraw endpoint was called.

## Scanner

`python src/scanner.py` exited 0.

- `active_sample=20 mode=paper live_enabled=false keys=none orders=none`
- Printed more than 5 public questions. First lines included the 2028 Democratic nomination markets (Oprah Winfrey, Beto O'Rourke, Hillary Clinton, MrBeast, Kim Kardashian) and the 2026 Senate balance markets.
- `data/markets.jsonl` has 20 records from the public Gamma `GET /markets` call. Highest sample liquidity was about $2.87M on the first row. That file is gitignored.

## Book

`python src/book.py` exited 0.

- Each `python src/book.py` run appended 10 public `GET /book` snapshots for the first 5 scanned markets (both outcome tokens). This verification ran it twice, so gitignored `data/books.jsonl` currently has 20 lines.
- Two-sided example: Hillary Clinton 2028 nomination. Yes bid 0.001 / ask 0.002 / spread 0.001. No bid 0.998 / ask 0.999 / spread 0.001.
- Several longshot tokens were one-sided (`spread=null`). RiskGate vetoes a missing spread. No order was sent.
- Records appended to gitignored `data/books.jsonl`.

## Paper ledger

`python src/paper_ledger.py` exited 0. RiskGate ran before every simulated fill.

- In-memory `live_enabled=true` was vetoed. `config/risk.toml` was not modified.
- Model probability equal to price was vetoed (`non_positive_edge`) after 0.005 assumed slippage.
- Spread 0.20 was vetoed (`spread_above_max`; cap is 0.04).
- Strategy name `wash-probe` was vetoed (`banned_behavior`) and did not fill.
- One labeled hypothetical fill was allowed: strategy `phase0-gate-test`, model_prob 0.70, market_price 0.40, edge 0.295, assumed_slippage 0.005, fee_usd 0, notional $10 (1% of the $1,000 paper bankroll). This probability is a gate fixture, not a forecast and not a claim of profit.
- A real public ask (Hillary Yes, price 0.002, same number used as model probability) was vetoed with `non_positive_edge`. It was not filled.
- `logs/bus.jsonl` received `signal`, `veto`, and `fill` lines in the `docs/PROTOCOL.md` shape. The only `fill` is from `Executor` and carries `risk_decision=allow`.
- `logs/paper.jsonl` is gitignored.

## Risk file

`config/risk.toml` is unchanged:

- `mode = "paper"`
- `live_enabled = false`
- `require_human_gate = true`
- `max_order_pct = 0.01`
- `max_daily_loss_pct = 0.03`

SHA256 before and after the run: `0aea23af1e938d330b5b4fab2c6abdec9f475f16807d177a5860a4da32aebc04`.

## Git

`git status` does not list `.env`. Ignored paths include `.env`, `data/`, and `logs/`.

## Not in this phase

No live trading, no key material, no CLOB authentication, no withdraw, no automatic size-up, and no geo-bypass steps. A single-leg fill is directional exposure, not risk-free arbitrage. Nothing here is a promise of profit.
